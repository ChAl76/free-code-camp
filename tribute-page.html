        <h2>Some of honors and awards</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1968</strong> Borlaug received what he considered an
            especially satisfying tribute when the people of Ciudad Obregón,
            where some of his earliest experiments were undertaken, named a
            street after him. Also in that year, he became a member of the U.S.
            National Academy of Sciences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970</strong> he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the
            Norwegian Nobel Committee "for his contributions to the 'green
            revolution' that was having such an impact on food production
            particularly in Asia and in Latin America."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1974</strong> he was awarded a Peace Medal (in the form of a
            dove, carrying a wheat ear in its beak) by Haryana Agricultural
            University, Hisar, India.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1980</strong> he was elected honorary member of the
            Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1986</strong> Borlaug was inducted into the
            Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame during Norsk Høstfest. Borlaug
            was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in
            1987.
